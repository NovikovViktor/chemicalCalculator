# chemicalCalculator

This is a small highly specialized application created for chemists who are engaged in checking the conformity of calorie content to technological cards. In order to make a calculation, you only need to enter the initial data and the measurement results. This application saves time and eliminates the possibility of calculation errors due to human factors.

Technologies that I use: Java 1.8, JavaFX, Lombok
